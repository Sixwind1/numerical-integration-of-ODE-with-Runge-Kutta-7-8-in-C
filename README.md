# numerical-integration-of-ODE-with-Runge-Kutta-7-8-in-C
This project is part of an undergraduate assignment from Universitat autonoma de barcelona (UAB). The code has 5 different parts: qr matrix decomposition, multidimensional newton method root finder, runge kutta 7-8 for a single step, numerical flow function using rk78 and an example problem solved with the previous flow function.
